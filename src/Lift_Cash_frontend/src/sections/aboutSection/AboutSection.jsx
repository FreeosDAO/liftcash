            It works by letting everyone vote in a collective monetary policy to
            earn an income in Lift Cash tokens weekly. This reflects the
            collective will of the community, promoting fairness and
            transparency.

            This vote is important because the monetary policy is designed to
            support a healthy price of the Lift Cash tokenâ€”through many
            innovative features and systems that govern supply and demand
            dynamics.
